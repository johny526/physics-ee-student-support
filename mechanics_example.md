# Mechanics Example: Block on an Inclined Plane

**Problem:**  
A 5 kg block is placed on a 30° frictionless inclined plane. Calculate the acceleration of the block and the time it takes to slide 2 meters down the incline.

**Solution:**

1. **Forces Acting:**
   - Weight (W) = mg = 5 × 9.8 = 49 N  
   - Component of weight along incline: Wₓ = mg sin(θ) = 49 × sin(30°) = 24.5 N  
   - Net force (F) = 24.5 N (no friction)

2. **Acceleration:**
   \( a = rac{F}{m} = rac{24.5}{5} = 4.9 \, m/s^2 \)

3. **Using kinematics to find time:**
   \( s = rac{1}{2} a t^2 \Rightarrow 2 = rac{1}{2} (4.9) t^2 \Rightarrow t^2 = rac{4}{4.9} \Rightarrow t pprox 0.90 \, s \)

**Answer:**  
- Acceleration = 4.9 m/s²  
- Time = ~0.90 seconds
