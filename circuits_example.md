# Circuits Example: RC Charging Circuit

**Problem:**  
A 10 µF capacitor is connected in series with a 1 kΩ resistor and a 5 V battery. Find the voltage across the capacitor after 1 second.

**Solution:**

1. **Time constant:**  
   \( 	au = RC = 1000 × 10 	imes 10^{-6} = 0.01 \, s \)

2. **Voltage across capacitor (charging):**  
   \( V(t) = V_0 (1 - e^{-t/RC}) = 5(1 - e^{-1/0.01}) \)

3. \( e^{-100} pprox 0 \), so  
   \( V(1s) pprox 5 \, V \)

**Answer:**  
Voltage across capacitor after 1 second is approximately **5 V** (fully charged).
